# Examining Geographic Disparities in Asthma Mortality Rates Across Counties in California

â€œThe dataset contains counts and rates (per 1,000,000 residents) of asthma deaths among Californians statewide and by county. The data are stratified by age group (all ages, 0-17, 18+) and reported for 3-year periods. The data are derived from the California Death Statistical Master Files, which contain information collected from death certificates. All deaths with asthma coded as the underlying cause of death (ICD-10 CM J45 or J46) are included.
